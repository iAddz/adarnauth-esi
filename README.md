# adarnauth-esi
Django app for accessing the EVE Swagger Interface.

## Quick Start

1. Add `esi` to your `INSTALLED_APPS` setting:

   `INSTALLED_APPS += 'esi'`

2. Include the esi urlconf in your project's urls:

    `url(r'^sso/', include('esi.urls'), namespace='esi'),`

3. Register an application with the [EVE Developers site](https://developers.eveonline.com/applications)

    If your application requires scopes, select `Authenticated API Access` and register all possible scopes your app can request. Otherwise `Authentication Only` will suffice.
    Set the `Callback URL` to `https://example.com/sso/callback`

4. Add SSO client settings to your project settings:

    `ESI_SSO_CLIENT_ID = "my client id"`
    
    `ESI_SSO_CLIENT_SECRET = "my client secret"`
    
    `ESI_SSO_CALLBACK_URL = "https://example.com/sso/callback"`
    

5. Run `python manage.py migrate` to create models.

## Usage in Views

When views require a token, wrap with the `token_required` decorator and accept a `token` arg:

    from esi.decorators import token_required

    @token_required()
    def my_view(request, token):
        ...

This will prompt the user to either select a token from their current ones, or if none exist create a new one via SSO.

To specify scopes, add either a list of names or a space-delimited string:

    @token_required(scopes=['esi-location.read_ship_type.v1', 'esi-location.read_location.v1'])
    @token_required(scopes='esi-location.read_ship_type.v1 esi-location.read_location.v1')

To require a new token, such as for logging in, add the `new` argument:

    @token_required(new=True)

To request all of a user's tokens which have the required scopes, wrap instead with the `tokens_required` decorator and accept a `tokens` arg:

    @tokens_required(scopes='esi-location.read_ship_type.v1')
    def my_view(request, tokens):
        ...

This skips prompting for token selection and instead passes that responsibility to the view. Tokens are provided as a queryset.

## Accessing the EVE Swagger Interface

adarnauth-esi provides a convenience wrapper around the [bravado SwaggerClient](https://github.com/Yelp/bravado).

### Getting a Client

To get a SwaggerClient configured for ESI, call the factory:

    from esi.client import esi_client_factory
    client = esi_client_factory()

### Accessing Authenticated Endpoints
 
To get an authenticated SwaggerClient, add the token argument:

    client = esi_client_factory(token=my_token)

Or, get the client from the specific token model instead:

    client = my_token.get_esi_client()

Authenticated clients will auto-renew tokens when needed, or raise a `TokenExpiredError` if they aren't renewable.

### Specifying Resource Versions

As explained on the [EVE Developers Blog](https://developers.eveonline.com/blog/article/breaking-changes-and-you), it's best practice to call a specific version of the resource and allow the ESI router to map it to the correct route, being `legacy`, `latest` or `dev`. 

Client initialization begins with a base swagger spec. By default this is the version defined in settings (`ESI_API_VERSION`), but can be overridden with an extra argument to the factory:

    client = esi_client_factory(version='v4')
    client = token.get_esi_client(version='v4')

Only resources with the specified version number will be available. For instance, if you specify `v4` but `Universe` does not have a `v4` version, it will not be available to that specific client. Only `legacy`, `latest` and `dev` are guaranteed to have all resources available.

Individual resources are versioned and can be accessed by passing additional arguments to the factory:

    client = esi_client_factory(Universe='v1', Character='v3')
    client = token.get_esi_client(Universe='v1', Character='v3')

A list of available resources is available on the [EVE Swagger Interface browser](https://esi.tech.ccp.is). If the resource is not available with the specified version, an `AttributeError` will be raised. 

This version of the resource replaces the resource originally initialized. If the requested base version does not have the specified resource, it will be added.

Note that only one old revision of each resource is kept available through the legacy route. Keep an eye on the [deployment timeline](https://github.com/ccpgames/esi-issues/projects/2/) for resource updates. 

### Accessing Alternate Datasources
 
ESI datasource can also be specified during client creation:
 
    client = esi_client_factory(datasource='tranquility')
 
Available datasources are `tranquility` and `singularity`.

## Cleaning the Database

If you have celerybeat running, two tasks are automatically scheduled:
 - `cleanup_callbackredirect` removes all `CallbackRedirect` models older than a specified age (in seconds). Default is 300, runs every 4 hours.
 - `cleanup_token` checks all `Token` models, and if expired, attempts to refresh. If expired and cannot refresh, or fails to refresh, the model is deleted. Runs every day.

## Operating on Singularity
 By defalt, adarnauth-esi process all operations on the tranquility cluster. To operate on singularity instead, two settings need to be changed:
  - `ESI_OAUTH_URL` should be set to `https://sisilogin.testeveonline.com/oauth`
  - `ESI_API_DATASOURCE` should be set to `singularity`
  
  Note that tokens cannot be transferred between servers. Any tokens in the database before switching to singularity will be deleted next refresh.
